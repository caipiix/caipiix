Fav quote:

People think there's one reality but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots. 
And what we do on one pathaffects what happens on the other paths. 
Time is a construct. 
People think you can't go back and change things, but you can, that's what flashbacks are, 
they're invitations to go back and make different choices. When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not. 
It's the spirit out there that's connected to our world that decides what we do and we just have to go along for the ride.
Mirrors let you move through time.
The government monitors people, 
they pay people to pretend to be your relatives and they put drugs in your food and they film you. 
There's messages in every game.
Like Pac-Man.
Do you know what PAC stands for? "Program and Control." 
He's Program and Control Man, the whole thing's a metaphor, he thinks he's got free will
but really he's trapped in a maze, in a system, all he can do is consume, he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head, and even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze, what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.
People think it's a happy game, it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.
It is all code. 
If you listen closely, you can hear the numbers.
There's a cosmic flowchart that dictates where you can and where you can't go.
